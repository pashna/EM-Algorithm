# EM-Algorithm

My own implementation of [Gaussian-Mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) model trainable with [EM-algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) for cluster analysis.

TSNE is used for clustering visualization, the clustring data is taken from Kaggle Twitter Competition.
